* Components screen:
*- Ask Luis for downloadable components, so we don't need to bundle them

* Python screen:
*- Check for valid python executable: does it execute? Is 32bit/64bit-ness ok (on windows)?
*- Use pythonExecutable from installer --> replace ${pythonExecutable} in config/snap.config

* File associations screen:
*- Must allow nbexec to have arguments and snap-rcp to honour these
*- Can we have sessions in SNAP 2?
